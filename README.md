# Detect profile of the speaker based on deep learning

## Abstract

While performing analysis of Quotebank data we found out that around 34% of quotations don't have assigned speakers to it (1.8 million out of 5.2 million in file quotes-2020.json). Our goal is to answer the following question: if we cannot determine the exact author of a quotation, what other information can we get from it?

In that work we would like to extract additional information about known authors parsing information from Wikipedia and use it to describe unknown authors thereby reducing their obscurity. With the data and labels, we trained several models and verified the functionalities, then predicted the features of the quotations that are not assigned speakers in Quotebank. Also, we did some analysis on the outcomes and explored the relationships between different features, as well as tried to understand the mechanism of the prediction.
